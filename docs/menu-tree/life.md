# L1: Life Menu Tree

This file is part of the canonical split-out menu tree spec. See [`../menu-tree-spec.md`](../menu-tree-spec.md) for the canonical index.

### L1: Life

```
L1: Life
├── P1: ... (group)                              ← one group per part, label computed via partLabel()
│   ├── Behavior: [none | life | sequencer | keys | looper | brain | ant | bounce | shapes | raindrops | dla | glider] ← controls which algorithm runs this part
│   ├── Step Rate: [1/16, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 1/1]   ← controls how often onTick() is called; hidden when Behavior is `none`
│   ├── ... per-behavior dynamic config from behavior's configMenu()
│   ├── Save Grid State: [on | off]              ← controls whether this part's current grid/runtime state is stored in preset/default saves
│   ├── Auto Label: [on | off]                   ← on: label auto-derives from behavior ID; off: label is manual text
│   └── Part Label: (text, max 32)               ← display label; editing sets Auto Label off
├── P2: ... (group)
└── P3: ... (group)                              ← up to partCount parts total
```

When Auto Label is on, the part label is derived from the active behavior ID (e.g. `life`, `brain`). Editing the Part Label text field switches Auto Label off.
Part selectors (Fn+column selection, L2 Sense Part selector) display the computed part label (e.g. `P1: life`, `P2: rain`).
When a part's behavior is `none`, the L1 part group shows Behavior, Auto Label, and Part Label only; Step Rate, dynamic behavior config rows, and Reset are hidden without deleting stored values.
Parameter target pickers mirror the main menu root order (`L1: Life`, `L2: Sense`, `L3: Voice`, `L4: Dance`, `System`). Within `L1: Life`, behavior `none` parts expose no Behavior targets, while real behavior parts expose `parts.N.algorithmStep` and `parts.N.l1.behaviorConfig.*` targets under their own part label.

Behavior-specific config items (from `configMenu()`):
